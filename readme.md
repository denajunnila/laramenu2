# LaraMenu 
## Using 2 Databases to create Applebee's menu

The purpose of the project was to learn different ways to hold data.Then to be able to pull the stored data to create a website. It was also to become proficient in creating new laravel projects.

*First* I learned to create an array to hold the data for Applebee's Menu contents.

*Second* the data was held in a single database.

*Third* (current build) I learned to put the Menu data into two databases.


I learned as a result of working on this that is if more effective and clearer to use a database rather than an array to store large amounts of data. I have also learned how to delete items from the database. I have also gained a clearer understanding on the relationships between the files in the laravel framework.
